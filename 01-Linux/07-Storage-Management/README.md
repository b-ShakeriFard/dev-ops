# 💾 Linux Storage Management

> Understanding disks, partitions, filesystems, mounts, and logical storage management in Linux.

# Overview

Every Linux system needs storage to:

- Store the operating system
- Save application data
- Host databases
- Store logs
- Provide persistent volumes

The Linux storage stack:

```text
Application

      |

      v

Filesystem

      |

      v

Mount Point

      |

      v

Logical Volume (LVM)

      |

      v

Partition

      |

      v

Physical Disk
```

# 🎯 What Problem Does Storage Management Solve?

Linux administrators need to answer:

- How much disk space is available?
- Which disk contains my data?
- How should disks be partitioned?
- Which filesystem should I use?
- How can I expand storage without downtime?
- How do I troubleshoot disk problems?

---

# 🧩 Storage Components

## Physical Disk

The actual storage device:

Examples:

```
/dev/sda

/dev/nvme0n1

/dev/vdb
```

View disks:

```bash
lsblk
```

---

## Partitions

A disk can be divided into smaller sections.

Example:

```
/dev/sda

 |
 +-- /dev/sda1
 |
 +-- /dev/sda2
 |
 +-- /dev/sda3
```

Tools:

```bash
fdisk
```

```bash
parted
```

---

## Filesystem

A filesystem organizes data on a disk.

Common Linux filesystems:

| Filesystem | Usage |
|-|-|
| ext4 | General Linux systems |
| XFS | Enterprise Linux default |
| tmpfs | Memory-based filesystem |

Examples:

```bash
mkfs.ext4
```

```bash
mkfs.xfs
```

---

## Mount Points

Linux accesses storage through directories.

Example:

```
Disk

/dev/sdb1

     |

     v

Mounted at:

 /data
```

View mounts:

```bash
mount
```

or:

```bash
df -h
```

---

# 🔥 LVM (Logical Volume Management)

LVM adds flexibility between disks and filesystems.

Traditional storage:

```
Disk

 |

Partition

 |

Filesystem
```

LVM:

```
Disk

 |

Physical Volume (PV)

 |

Volume Group (VG)

 |

Logical Volume (LV)

 |

Filesystem
```

Benefits:

- Resize storage
- Combine disks
- Create flexible layouts
- Take snapshots

# 🛠️ Essential Storage Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `lsblk` | List disks and partitions |
| `fdisk` | Manage partitions |
| `parted` | Advanced partition management |
| `blkid` | Show filesystem information |
| `mkfs` | Create filesystem |
| `mount` | Attach filesystem |
| `umount` | Detach filesystem |
| `df -h` | Show filesystem usage |
| `du -sh` | Show directory usage |
| `lvs` | Show logical volumes |
| `vgs` | Show volume groups |
| `pvs` | Show physical volumes |

# 🖥️ Real Linux Example

A server administrator receives a new disk:

```
/dev/sdb

1 TB
```

The workflow:

## 1. Detect disk

```bash
lsblk
```

---

## 2. Create partition

```bash
fdisk /dev/sdb
```

---

## 3. Create filesystem

Example:

```bash
mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1
```

---

## 4. Create mount point

```bash
mkdir /data
```

---

## 5. Mount storage

```bash
mount /dev/sdb1 /data
```

---

## 6. Make persistent

Configure:

```text
/etc/fstab
```

---

# ☸️ DevOps Connection

Linux storage concepts are the foundation of container storage.

Traditional Linux:

```
Disk

 |

Filesystem

 |

Application
```

Kubernetes:

```
Storage Device

 |

Persistent Volume

 |

Persistent Volume Claim

 |

Pod

 |

Application
```

Understanding Linux storage makes Kubernetes storage much easier.

# Conclusion

Storage management is one of the core responsibilities of a Linux administrator.

The essential path is:

```text
